# Discord
## What is Discord?
Discord, according to Wikipedia, is a... freeware VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for video gaming communities, that specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of May 2018, there are 130 million unique users of the software.
## How do I join?
You can join by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/R8YrXd6). 
## I joined, but can't chat. Help!
For security reasons, you must have a verified email, and wait 10 minutes before being able to talk. 
## This is called `Discord` so, can I have chaos and discord here?
No, we ask that you follow all rules in the server, Discord's [Terms of Service](https://dicordapp.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines). 
## What can I do?
In this server you can chat with people about anything you want, as long as it isn't against our rules. You could ask for help, request features or report bugs. You could ask for JavaScript development help too.

This is just a friendly reminder that you may ask for help, but only our verified Helpers can answer questions regarding to Permissions. (Other questions are fair game!) If you know this module very well, you will get a quiz, and if you pass you get the Helper role!
